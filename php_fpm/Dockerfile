# We want to add some additional configuration at runtime, but the entrypoint script doesn't run as root and only has
# permission to write to /tmp. So, we create a symlink that doesn't exist yet but will before php-fpm is started.
# This shouldn't allow arbritrary config modifications even though /tmp is publicly writable: a container restart is
# required to load new configuration and restarting the container overwrites this config file.
# A bit weird, I know, but it's the best I could come up with. Suggestions welcome!
